# cnn-model-cancer-detection
## Problem description
The goal of this project is to develop an image classification model to detect cancerous cells in histopathologic samples. This is a computer vision problem applied to medicine, aiming to assist in early cancer detection through automated image analysis.


##### Project Objectives

- Train and compare different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for binary classification.

- Evaluate model performance using AUC and other metrics like Accuracy.

## Data description
The data is donwloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data competition. It is composed by the following files and folders:
- Test folder: This contains the images to classify for the challenge
- Train folder: This contains the images to train the model
- sample_submission.csv: Is the file as example of the sumbission that we need to upload
- tran_labels.csv: The file containing the label for each image in the training folder
